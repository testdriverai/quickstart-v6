steps:
  # Starting from a file
  # You can write your test plan/steps/exit criteria in a set of prompts like you see below instead of using the interactive mode (see mytest.yaml)
  # TestDriver can also generate these prompts using the /generate command - see https://docs.testdriver.ai/features/generation
  # These are the steps that will be executed in the test
  # You can add more steps as needed and TestDriver will execute them in order, creating commands on the fly
  # if you want to save these steps use the --heal and --write flags
  # Docs for the `heal` command: https://docs.testdriver.ai/features/auto-healing
  # --heal allows testdriver to automatically retry steps that fail
  # --write will update this file with the working steps for the given prompts
